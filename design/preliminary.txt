Inital questions:

0. At what depth can a snp occuring at frequency 0.001 in a population be identified by next gen sequencing.
Ans: Approx. 3 million paired end reads (total 6 million reads) for a randomly generated genome of 10 kb. Refer to preliminary/experiment0 and preliminary/rangenome10k_MPE6mil. 
Method: Reads are generated at different depths and the depth that is most successful in recovering most snps is reported. Directory experiment0 has reads for paired end method and rangenome10k_MPE6mil has 6 mil reads generated by mate-pair method. Both methods recover almost all snps at depth = 3 million paired reads (= 6 million total reads).


1a. Does haplotype construction accuracy suffer as haplotype frequency decreases?
Ans: Refer to preliminary/experiment1/hapConstructAcc_vs_hapFreq
Method: For one hap (containing 500 snps), calculate hap construction accuracy when hap occurs at frequencies (out of 1): 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001.


1b. At what sequencing depth can a hap occuring with frequency 0.001 be successfully constructed?
Ans: Refer to preliminary/experiment1/requiredDepth
Method: For one hap at one frequency (0.001), calculate hap construction at different sequencing depths: 6 mil, 7 mil, 8 mil


2a. Can one resolve two haps at different frequencies (test of hap construction code)? At what depth?
Ans: Refer to preliminary/experiment2/resolveHapMixture
Method: Calculate hap construction accuracy for two haps with mixture ratios of a)equal: 0.5/0.5; and b)unequal: 0.8/0.2


2b. Can one resolve two haps at low frequencies? At what depth?
And: Refer to preliminary/experiment2/resolveLowFreqHapMix
Method: See how well does the hap construction code resolves haps at freq: 0.5/0.5, 0.2/0.2, 0.1/0.1, 0.01/0.01, 0.001/0.001
